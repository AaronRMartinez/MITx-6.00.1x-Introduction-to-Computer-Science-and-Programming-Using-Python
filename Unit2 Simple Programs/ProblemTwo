Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 
months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount 
that will be paid each month.

In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.

The following variables contain values as described below:

1. balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
2. annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example: 

Lowest Payment: 180 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
monthlyPaymentRate = 0
initial_balance = balance
monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate/12

while balance > 0:
    for i in range(12):
        balance = balance - monthlyPaymentRate + ((balance - monthlyPaymentRate) * monthlyInterestRate)
    if balance > 0:
        monthlyPaymentRate += 10
        balance = initial_balance
    elif balance <= 0:
        break
print('Lowest Payment:', monthlyPaymentRate)
